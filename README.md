# Vue 3 Migration: A real life story
Presentation and resources from my London Vue Meetup presentation in the spring of 2023. See in the repo for my slides, and below for some
links and resources I mentioned.

## Vue migration plugin
To complete the heavy lifting of code changes, we installed, ran and then removed this vue next plugin: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli-plugin-vue-next.
It seems to be abandoned in preview state, but might still be worth looking into.

## Vue Scoped CSS ESLint Plugin
This plugin was very handy in figuring out what CSS was working, and what might not have been.
